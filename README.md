## Description

Guitar pedal designed to "tighten" your sound when running a high gain amplifier. Features include the following:

- High-pass filter: cleans up muddiness by controlling low end information
- Mid bump: enhances pick attack and raspiness
- Overdrive: this soft clipping stage compresses the signal and provides a little grit to help with the amp's saturation
- Low pass filter: controls high-end information introduced from the soft clipping stage.
